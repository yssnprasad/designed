• Challenges Faced: Image not loading
• • Solutions Implemented: We can use various types of images inserted like img tags 
for Using a background image for a <div> element: This is useful when you want to 
set a background image for a section of your webpage, such as a header or a hero 
section. You can control the size, position, and other properties of the background 
image using CSS.
• Using a background image for a profile picture: Instead of directly embedding the 
image with the <img> tag, you can use a <div> element with a specific size and 
shape (e.g., a circle for a profile picture) and set the image as its background. This 
gives you more control over the appearance of the image, such as adding borderradius for rounded corners.

design preferences. It's common in web development to use a combination of different
